		<h1>The <label class="animal">null</label></u> And The <label class="another_animal">null</label></h1>
		<p>A <label class="animal">null</label> was making fun of the <label class="another_animal">null</label> one day for being so slow.</p>
		<p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>
		<p><q><label id="yesno">null</label></q> replied the <label class="another_animal">null</label>.<q> and I get there <label id="speed">null</label> than you think.. I'll run you a race and prove it.</q></p>
		<p>The <label class="animal">null</label> was much <label id="adjective">null</label> at the idea of running a race with the <label class="another_animal">null</label>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <label id="more_animal"></label> , who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, <q><label id="quote">null</label></q>.</p>
		<p>The <label class="animal">null</label> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <label class="another_animal">null</label> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <label class="animal">null</label>, he went off the course to practice running for <label id="hours">null</label> hours until the <label class="another_animal">null</label> should catch up.</p>
		<p>The <label class="another_animal">null</label> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <label class="animal">null</label> was <label class="verb">null</label>. The <label class="animal">null</label> was so caught up in <label class="verb">null</label> and when at last he did stop, the <label class="another_animal">null</label> was near the goal. the <label class="animal">null</label> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <label class="another_animal">null</label> in time.</p>
